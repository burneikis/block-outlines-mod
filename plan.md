# Basic Approach
You'll create a "fake" falling sand entity that exists only in your client's world simulation. The server won't know about it, and other players won't see it.

## Key Components

### 1. Custom Entity Class
```java
public class ClientFallingSandEntity extends FallingBlockEntity {
    public ClientFallingSandEntity(World world, double x, double y, double z, BlockState blockState) {
        super(EntityType.FALLING_BLOCK, world);
        this.setPosition(x, y, z);
        this.block = blockState;
    }
    
    // Override tick method to handle client-side physics
    @Override
    public void tick() {
        super.tick();
        // Add custom behavior like despawning after a certain time
    }
}
```

### 2. Client-Side Spawning
You'll need to add the entity to the client world:
```java
ClientWorld world = MinecraftClient.getInstance().world;
ClientFallingSandEntity entity = new ClientFallingSandEntity(
    world, x, y, z, Blocks.SAND.getDefaultState()
);
world.addEntity(entity.getId(), entity);
```

### 3. Entity Registration
Register your entity type in your mod initializer:
```java
public static final EntityType<ClientFallingSandEntity> CLIENT_FALLING_SAND = 
    Registry.register(Registries.ENTITY_TYPE, "your_mod:client_falling_sand",
        FabricEntityTypeBuilder.<ClientFallingSandEntity>create()
            .dimensions(EntityDimensions.fixed(0.98f, 0.98f))
            .build());
```

## Implementation Considerations

- **Entity ID Management**: You'll need to manage entity IDs carefully to avoid conflicts with server entities
- **Cleanup**: Remember to remove your client entities when changing dimensions or disconnecting
- **Performance**: Consider limiting the number of client entities to avoid performance issues
- **Collision**: The entity will have physics and collision detection on your client

## Triggering the Spawn
You could trigger the entity spawn through:

- A keybind
- Chat commands (client-side command registration)
- Game events (like block breaking)
- GUI interactions

This approach works because Minecraft's client maintains its own world simulation that can include additional entities beyond what the server sends. The vanilla server will be completely unaware of your custom entities.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation?
